# Platform Marketing Project

This repository contains a simple marketing platform demo with a frontend built using Vue 3 and a backend based on Spring Boot 2.5.

The permission management module is implemented in `/frontend/src/views/PermissionView.vue` and corresponding backend code under `/backend`.

See `frontend/README.md` for instructions on running the client and `backend/pom.xml` for backend dependencies.
